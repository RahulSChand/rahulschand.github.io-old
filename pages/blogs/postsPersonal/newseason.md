## Season

1. **Gameweek 1:** `Arsenal vs Nottn Forest (2-1). 3 points but got beat on xG`

    **1.** Same issues as last season against low blocks. Attack is too predictable, its always odegaard and saka trying to create something. Too much reliance on odegaard for creativity without him our attack sucks. Need a new attacking signing, someone more direct like Martinelli but on the right wing. Edu please get Kudus 🙏  


    **2.** Man city look too strong again, don't see how any team catches them. Newcastle look like if you make a team just out of PnP beasts, feel like they will be a dark horse for Champions league.
