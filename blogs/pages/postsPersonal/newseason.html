<h2>Season</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gameweek 1:</strong> <code class="">Arsenal vs Nottn Forest (2-1). 3 points but got beat on xG</code></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Same issues as last season against low blocks. Attack is too predictable, its always odegaard and saka trying to create something. Too much reliance on odegaard for creativity without him our attack sucks. Need a new attacking signing, someone more direct like Martinelli but on the right wing. Edu please get Kudus üôè</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Man city look too strong again, don&#x27;t see how any team catches them. Newcastle look like if you make a team just out of PnP beasts, feel like they will be a dark horse for Champions league.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gameweek 1:</strong> <code class="">Crystal Palace vs Arsenal (0-1). 3 points. Bad refreeing. Narrow Win.</code></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Lucky win. Didn&#x27;t produce much. No attacking identiy. Arteta high on his own tactico koolaid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gameweek 1:</strong> <code class="">Arsenal vs Fulham (2-2). 1 point. Embarrassing</code></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> One of the worst performances under Arteta. 2-1 ahead against 10 men with 5 minutes to go &amp; we concede. Concede early, chase all game has become the norm in home games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gameweek 4:</strong> <code class="">Arsenal vs ManUTD (3-1). 3 points. We own United :)</code></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Declan Rice is the best CDM in the world after Rodri.</p>
